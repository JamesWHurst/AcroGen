# AcroGen
An Acrobat Document Generation-Code Generator Tool

If you're using the iText7 library to generate an Acrobat (PDF) document file within your Java or C# code, then you may want to consider using this tool. AcroGen does not create the Acrobat document, but rather it generates something that you can use to generate it within your code. This is via either of
1. a definition file, which then *your* code can call the library provided by this project to read that definition file and generate your document. or
2. generate the code directly which will create the Acrobat document. You can then further modify this code to accomplish your specific needs.

This project is to be implemented in both Java and C#.
